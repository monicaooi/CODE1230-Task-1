            <p> Urban transformation is the city’s physical ability to adapt and transform 
                according to the changing social dynamics and current demands within the city and the world.</p> 
        <br>
            <p> Norrebro district is home to the Superkilen, a public park made up of 
                three sections that stretches one kilometer long. This key move forced people to 
                interact and with one another and their surrounding environment. </p>

               <p> Superkilen is a public park in an urban area. It is made up of 3 sections (the Red Square, the Black Market and the Green Park) that are all connected to each other in one long strip that stretches 1km long. </p>

            <h3>The Red Square:</h3>
               <p> Consists of bright red, orange and pink concrete floor. Used mainly for sport as the strip has basketball rings and is not car accessible. </p>

            <h3>The Black Market:</h3>
               <p> An area visually identifiable by the strips of white lines on the concrete strip. THis is a more relaxed area filled with a large fountain and a series of benches. It is an area where people can gather to have a bbq, play chess or meet up. </p>

            <h3>The Green Park:</h3>
               <p> A traditional park filled with a lot of greenery and a playground. </p>

            <br>
               <p> Housing buildings are found along the strip where Superkilen is located, which can make these areas, along with their colours look separate. But like much of the inhabitants in the area, they are connected all together because they are physically in that 1km strip that is designed for only bicycles to enter. </p>

           <h2>URBAN TRANSFORMATION APPROACH</h2>
              <p> Seen as an "extreme form of public participation" as the design was dependent on the idea that its inhabitants would be open to participate in using the park. The notion that the community would participate in these 3 spaces and socially integrate and build stronger relationships in the community. During the building of Superkilen the designers "reached out to the local population inviting them to propose urban elements from their other home countries. By transformating public process into a pro-active proposition they created a park for the people by the people with peer-to-peer design" (http://revolve.media/superkilen-implementing-urban-diversity/). </p>
        <br>
        <br>
           <h2>NØRREBRO DISTRICT</h2>
              <h3> Population:</h3>
                 <p> Nørrebro neighbourhood has "more than 60+ nationalities" (http://Revolve.Media/Superkilen-Implementing-Urban-Diversity/). Nørrebro is also heavily populated. In 2018 it has a population density of 19,652/km² (https://www.citypopulation.de/php/denmark-copenhagen.php?cityid=K03) </p> 
           <br>
           <br>
              <h3> Economy: </h3>
                 <p> Nørrebro district has a low economy compared with other districts in The Netherlands. The gap has been growing continuously overtime. A survey in 2005 conducted in Copenhagen showed that 3.9% of its inhabitants "have lived in poverty for 4 years or more (defined as long-term and permanent poor)" ((Elm Larsen, J. and Hornemann Möller, I.2013. 'The increasing socioeconomic and spatial segregation and polarization of living conditions in the Copenhagen metropolitan area'. DIVA. <http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:1nu:diva-28813>). Despite this being a relatively low number, poverty in Copenhagen is not evenly spread out and Nørrebro in particular has "high concentrated areas" of poverty (Elm Larsen, J. and Hornemann Möller, I.2013. 'The increasing socioeconomic and spatial segregation and polarization of living conditions in the Copenhagen metropolitan area'. DIVA. <http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:1nu:diva-28813>). </p>

           <h2>ARGUMENTS & PEOPLE AGAINST 'SUPERKILEN'</h2>
              <p> The arguments against Superkilen park were mainly sparked by the increase in tourism this district would receive. Since the completion of Superkilen it has attracted many more tourists, and this has sparked people wanting to benefit off tourists. "Ghetto Tours" are tours in which some of the inhabitants show tourists around the area and their housing blocks. Despite the positive and the negative perspectives of these tours, it ultimately leads to gentrification of the district increasing prices for those who live there (more information at: https://www.citylab.com/equity/2016/06/slum-tourism-problematic-but-not-necessarily-in-the-way-you-might-think/487055/) </p>
        <br>
        <br>
           <h2>ARGUMENTS & PEOPLE FOR 'SUPERKILEN'</h2>
              <p> Since the completion of 'Superkilen' inhabitants say they feel 'safer' in the area. The incorporation of peoples country of origin have been a very beneficial process, that has strengthened the already multicultural area. It is also very important to refugees who have had to flee their home country and now live there. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
           <h2> 'SUPERKILEN' - SUCCESS OR FAILURE</h2>
              <p> Superkilen was designed to encourage morale between a neighbourhood where there are many different ethnicities. The space was designed to engage community members to participate and interact with one another in the park. I believe Superkilen has done what it designed to do and I think getting public-involvement in the decision of what objects should symbolsie countries made the project alot more personal and effective. </p>

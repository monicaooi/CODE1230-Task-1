     <p>"A former container wharf on the edge of Sydney’s magnificent harbour,<br/> is now 
       the site of one of the most significant urban regeneration projects in the city’s 
       history. "<p/>

  <h>South Brangaroo</h><br><br>
  <p>Urban transformation is the city’s physical ability 
    to adapt and transform according to the changing social 
    dynamics and current demands within the city and the world.
</p> <br><br>
  
  <p>South Barangaroo was originally a container wharf and is transformed 
    into a new waterfront financial district with a mix of office space, 
    residential buildings, shopping, dining, hotel, hospitality and public spaces. 
    The land wharf could no longer keep up with the space needed as ships became 
    larger and thus the downfall of Barangaroo. </p><br><br>

  <p>Barangaroo before development. The large space was not in use.</p><br><br>
  
  <p>In 2003, the government decided to renew the area and expand the Sydney CBD as 
    it was a prime location of the Sydney Harbour side view. According to the 
    Barangaroo Proposal, the land will become home to around 1,800 residents 
    and 23,000 office workers and, with more than 50% of the precinct open public 
    space and 100% of the foreshore to be fully accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, 
    it is expected to attract some 18 million visits per year.</p><br><br>

     <p>"A former container wharf on the edge of Sydney’s magnificent harbour,<br/> is now 
       the site of one of the most significant urban regeneration projects in the city’s 
       history. "<p/>

  <h>South Brangaroo</h><br><br>
  <p>Urban transformation is the city’s physical ability 
    to adapt and transform according to the changing social 
    dynamics and current demands within the city and the world.
</p> <br><br>
  
  <p>South Barangaroo was originally a container wharf and is transformed 
    into a new waterfront financial district with a mix of office space, 
    residential buildings, shopping, dining, hotel, hospitality and public spaces. 
    The land wharf could no longer keep up with the space needed as ships became 
    larger and thus the downfall of Barangaroo. </p><br><br>

  <p>Barangaroo before development. The large space was not in use.</p><br><br>
  
  <p>In 2003, the government decided to renew the area and expand the Sydney CBD as 
    it was a prime location of the Sydney Harbour side view. According to the 
    Barangaroo Proposal, the land will become home to around 1,800 residents 
    and 23,000 office workers and, with more than 50% of the precinct open public 
    space and 100% of the foreshore to be fully accessible to pedestrians and cyclists, 
    it is expected to attract some 18 million visits per year.</p><br><br>

 <p>The chief executive of the Barangaroo Delivery Authority, Craig van der Laan
   <br>
   “Barangaroo will be a place everyone will want to visit when they come to Sydney. At one level it will be admired as an ambitious project which kick-started a new wave of urban regeneration for Sydney, a showcase of sustainability and an integral part of the fabric of the city.
   <br>
   But Barangaroo will be much more than that. It will be a vibrant, dynamic precinct which has something for everyone: a place to work, a place to live, a place to relax, a place to commune and enjoy amazing public art, a place to celebrate and a place to learn more about Australia’s rich Indigenous history and the future of the world’s oldest living culture.”

<br>But I should also say that, at the same East Darling Harbour, now Barangaroo, I am supporting a grand-scale development which represents a paradigm change in the way our CBDs normally approach the water.

<p>the billionaire’s son Jamie Packer
  <br>
Packer spruiked the six-star hotel as his real interest and the casino as a necessity, begrudgingly shouldered.
<br>A hotel had always been part of the plan for Barangaroo, and Packer himself has acknowledged Sydney’s hotel shortage.
<br> A report by Tourism Accommodation Australia in 2012 found Sydney needed to add 5,000 rooms in less than 10 years to keep up with demand, and Lend Lease said in 2012 it had plenty of interest from potential partners wanting to develop the hotel at Barangaroo. But suddenly, according to Packer, a high roller casino was needed to make the hotel financially viable. 
<br>Serendipitously, he happened to be in the casino business as well.

“In our submission we argued that Packer’s tower should be moved close to Hickson Road and the area where he wants to build it should revert to foreshore park,” said Millers Point Fund spokesman John McInerney, a former City of Sydney councillor.

“Profit and private interests are clearly being put ahead of public good. Barangaroo is public land owned by us all, but the Liberal/National Government is bending over backwards to install a casino, multi-million dollar apartments and parking that will only benefit developers.”

But the companies are understood to be furious about a push for increased building heights at neighbouring Barangaroo Central that they feel threaten revenue flowing from their developments due to a loss of sight lines across the harbour.

The National Trust also objected, citing the “seemingly endless modifications” to the site, “each increasing the development density and height and which confirm the inherent defects in the current planning system”.

<h>Summary
  </h>
<p>The starting point for this urban transformation goal is good, but according to various controversies and completions and future plans, the ultimate goal of urban transformation should be to better serve the people living on this land, rather than pursue the maximization of economic benefits
